cd repository-name
2. Frontend Setup (React)
The frontend is built with React. Follow these steps to set it up:

Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copier
Modifier
cd professional-kitchen-front
Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:

bash
Copier
Modifier
npm install
Run the Frontend:

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server:

bash
Copier
Modifier
npm start
The React application will be running at http://localhost:3000.

3. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
The backend is built with Spring Boot. Follow these steps to set it up:

Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copier
Modifier
cd professional-kitchen-backend-spring
Install Java and Maven:

The Spring Boot backend will be running at http://localhost:8080.

4. Adding a Database
You can add a database to the backend, depending on your project requirements. For example, hereâ€™s how to integrate MySQL:

Add MySQL Dependencies:

Add the MySQL dependency in the pom.xml file:

xml
Copier
Modifier
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
</dependency>
Configure Database Connection:

properties
Copier
Modifier
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
Create Database Tables:

You can use Spring Data JPA to automatically create the tables from your entities. Make sure to create JPA entity classes in your project.

Run the Backend Again:

Restart the Spring Boot application to apply the database configuration.
